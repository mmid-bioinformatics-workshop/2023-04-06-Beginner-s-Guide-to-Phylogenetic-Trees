## Course Description 

This workshop will provide demonstrations and exercises for performing basic and rapid accumulation of phylogenomic data using efficient phylogenomic software. Specifically, we will discuss different methods and tools for phylogenomics, and use IQ-TREE to build a maximum-likelihood tree in Newick format from a multiple sequence alignment. We will also explore interactive tree viewing tools.
